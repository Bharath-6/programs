# python packages 
## In mark down language
We learned that modules are files containing Python statements and definitions, like function and class definitions. We will learn in this chapter how to bundle multiple modules together to form a package.

A **_package_** is basically a directory with Python files and a file with the name __init__.py. This means that every directory inside of the Python path, which contains a file named __init__.py, will be treated as a package by Python. It's possible to put several modules into a Package.

Packages are a way of structuring Pyt*honâ€™s module namespace by using "dotted module names". A.B stands for a submodule named B in a package named A. Two different packages like P1 and P2 can both have modules with the same name, let's say A, for example. The submodule A of the package P1 and the submodule A of the package P2 can be totally different. A package is imported like a "normal" module. We will start this chapter with a simple example.
