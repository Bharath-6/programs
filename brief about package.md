## WHAT IS PYTHON PACKAGE?
A python package is a collection of modules. Modules that are related to each other are mainly put in the same package. When a module from an external package is required in a program, that package can be imported and its modules can be put to use.

# HOW DO USE PYTHON PACKAGES?
You can import modules in the directory you run the program in directly, but if you want to import modules from other directories, you have to let Python know that the directory youâ€™re importing from is a Python package. To do that, you put a file called init.py in that directory.

## There several packages
### 1) Pandas:
Pandas is primarily used for data analysis, and it is one of the most commonly used Python libraries. It provides you with some of the most useful set of tools to explore, clean, and analyze your data. With Pandas, you can load, prepare, manipulate, and analyze all kinds of structured data. Machine learning libraries also revolve around Pandas DataFrames as an input.

### 2)numpy:
NumPy is mainly used for its support for N-dimensional arrays. These multi-dimensional arrays are 50 times more robust compared to Python lists, making NumPy a favorite for data scientists.

NumPy is also used by other libraries such as TensorFlow for their internal computation on tensors. NumPy also provides fast precompiled functions for numerical routines, which can be hard to manually solve. To achieve better efficiency, NumPy uses array-oriented computations, so working with multiple classes becomes easy.
### 3)Scikit-learn:
Scikit-learn is arguably the most important library in Python for machine learning. After cleaning and manipulating your data with Pandas or NumPy, scikit-learn is used to build machine learning models as it has tons of tools used for predictive modelling and analysis.
### 4)gradio:
Gradio lets you build and deploy web apps for your machine learning models in as little as three lines of code. It serves the same purpose as Streamlit or Flask, but I found it much faster and easier to get a model deployed.
### 5)tensor flow:
TensorFlow is one of the most popular libraries of Python for implementing neural networks. It uses multi-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors, which allows it to perform several operations on a particular input.

Because it is highly parallel in nature, it can train multiple neural networks and GPUs for highly efficient and scalable models. This feature of TensorFlow is also called pipelining.
### 6)scipy:
As the name suggests, SciPy is mainly used for its scientific functions and mathematical functions derived from NumPy. Some useful functions which this library provides are stats functions, optimization functions, and signal processing functions. To solve differential equations and provide optimization, it includes functions for computing integrals numerically. Some of the applications which make SciPy important are:
### 7)Statsmodels:
Statsmodels is a great library for doing hardcore statistics. This multifunctional library is a blend of different Python libraries, taking its graphical features and functions from Matplotlib, for data handling, it uses Pandas, for handling R-like formulas, it uses Pasty, and is built on NumPy and SciPy.
### 8)Plotly:
Plotly is definitely a must-know tool for building visualizations since it is extremely powerful, easy to use, and has a big benefit of being able to interact with the visualizations.

Along with Plotly is Dash, which is a tool that allows you to build dynamic dashboards using Plotly visualizations. Dash is a web-based python interface that removes the need for JavaScript in these types of analytical web applications and allows you to run these plots online and offline.
### 9)seaborn:
Built on the top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is an effective library for creating different visualizations.

One of the most important features of Seaborn is the creation of amplified data visuals. Some of the correlations that are not obvious initially can be displayed in a visual context, allowing Data Scientists to understand the models more properly.

Due to its customizable themes and high-level interfaces, it provides well-designed and extraordinary data visualizations, hence making the plots very attractive, which can, later on, be shown to stakeholders.
